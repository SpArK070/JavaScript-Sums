// Description
            // You are given three numbers, stored in variables with the following names
            // one, two, three
            // You have to find the square of the three numbers, and find the sum of their square values
            // Note : Square of a number, is a number multiplied by itself. For example, the square of 3, is 3 * 3 = 9
            
            
            // Hint
            // In the sample test case, the value stored inone = 1, two = 2, three = 3.
            // The square of the values stored will be          
            // one = 1 * 1 = 1           
            // two = 2 * 2 = 4            
            // three = 3 * 3 = 9            
            // The resultant sum becomesone + two + three = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14, which is the required answer.
//output = 14;
